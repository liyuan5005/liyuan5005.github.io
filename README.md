Team Name: Attention Please.

We designed different visualization tools for the user and the business. For the business, we built a heat map to monitor the flow of customers and built a review river to see the store. For users, we constructed maps and parallel coordinates to help users make rough choices and constructed positive and negative word clouds and radar charts to help users compare in detail.
